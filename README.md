## The subject

### 1 - The Choice:

A minimum choice must be made on the character, personal choice, class choice,
weapon or other. This choice must affect the character interpreted by the player/the
player.

### 2 - Gameplay Loop

The heart of the game, the character will repeat this event as long as he is not dead or
that he didn't win. You are free to unwind a loop, however at least
a click is required to go to the next loop.

### 3 - End of game conditions

It's up to you to determine them, but one or more events must lead to the end of the
games whether it is a win or a loss. The game over must be clear to the
player
